### Overview

It's a simple application that has authorization and authentication via session cookie. There is an admin (one) and there are regular users. The first user who registers will be the admin. The regular can create payrolls that contain his information and qualifications and his salary. The admin can approve these payrolls. If they are approved, then they are included in the sample. There is a sample, user can specify his data and get all payrolls with similar data.
